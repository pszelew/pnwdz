Dobrygowski Sp. z o.o. to autoryzowany dealer Toyoty, posiadający 2 salony sprzedaży na Dolnym Śląsku oraz sześciokrotny zdobywca tytułu Dealera Roku. Niesamowite tempo rozwoju salonów Toyota Dobrygowski spowodowało, że Zarząd podjął decyzję o wydzieleniu ze struktury firmy działu flotowego i w 2015 roku powołał do życia spółkę Kaizen Fleet, dając jednocześnie jej pracownikom pełną swobodę działania i realny wpływ na dalszy rozwój spółki. Pod skrzydłami nowego Zarządu spółka rozpoczęła ekspansję, obejmując swoim działaniem całą Polskę. W 2017 roku Zarząd podjął decyzję o poszerzeniu zakresu działalności o usługę najmu krótkoterminowego i tak w sierpniu pojawiły się w kilku miastach Polski pierwsze oddziały wypożyczalni samochodowej Kaizen Rent.

Eventy budowane są na dwóch podstawach – najwyższej merytoryce oraz kreatywności, która zaskakuje i wciąż przyciąga nowych odwiedzających.\nW portfolio firmy znajdują się takie pozycje, jak FIWE Fitness Trade Show – największe na Starym Kontynencie targi branży fitness i wellness. Najlepszym dowodem na wysoką jakość wydarzenia jest prestiżowa nagroda MP POWER AWARDS, którą wyróżniono wspomniane FIWE. Grupa IC stoi również za organizacją eventów biznesowych. Wśród nich wyjątkową renomą cieszy National Sales Congress, którego tematyka z biegiem lat zaczęła wykraczać poza zarządzanie sprzedażą, rozszerzając pole zagadnień o branżę hotelarską (NSC Hotels), management zespołowy (NSC Director) czy też marketing wsparcia sprzedaży (NSC Marketing Wsparcia Sprzedaży). Ponadto, firma odpowiada również za takie marki, jak eTrade Show (e-commerce), Franczyza EXPO (franczyza), REHA Trade Show (rehabilitacja i fizjoterapia), czy też WOW Fashion (branża modowa).\nCo jest gwarancją najwyższego poziomu organizowanych przez Grupę IC wydarzeń? To, że mimo kryzysu w branży eventowej spowodowanego koronawirusem firma obroniła się na rynku dzięki swojej marce i zaufaniu uczestników. Ze stagnacji wyszła silniejsza, rozszerzając portfolio o kolejne pozycje.\nW Grupie IC działają młode osoby z głowami pełnymi pomysłów. Dynamiczny zespół konstruowany był w oparciu nie tylko o posiadane umiejętności, ale również o chemię, która powoduje, że nie ma czegoś takiego, jak wyzwanie nie do zrealizowania.

Każde z nich cechują jakość, najlepsi prelegenci, ale przede wszystkim zadowolenie i satysfakcja uczestników. Eventy budowane są na dwóch podstawach – najwyższej merytoryce oraz kreatywności, która zaskakuje i wciąż przyciąga nowych odwiedzających.\nW portfolio firmy znajdują się takie pozycje, jak FIWE Fitness Trade Show – największe na Starym Kontynencie targi branży fitness i wellness. Najlepszym dowodem na wysoką jakość wydarzenia jest prestiżowa nagroda MP POWER AWARDS, którą wyróżniono wspomniane FIWE. Grupa IC stoi również za organizacją eventów biznesowych. Wśród nich wyjątkową renomą cieszy National Sales Congress, którego tematyka z biegiem lat zaczęła wykraczać poza zarządzanie sprzedażą, rozszerzając pole zagadnień o branżę hotelarską (NSC Hotels), management zespołowy (NSC Director) czy też marketing wsparcia sprzedaży (NSC Marketing Wsparcia Sprzedaży). Ponadto, firma odpowiada również za takie marki, jak eTrade Show (e-commerce), Franczyza EXPO (franczyza), REHA Trade Show (rehabilitacja i fizjoterapia), czy też WOW Fashion (branża modowa).\nCo jest gwarancją najwyższego poziomu organizowanych przez Grupę IC wydarzeń? To, że mimo kryzysu w branży eventowej spowodowanego koronawirusem firma obroniła się na rynku dzięki swojej marce i zaufaniu uczestników.
